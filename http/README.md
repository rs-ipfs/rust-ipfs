# ipfs-http crate

HTTP api on top of ipfs crate. The end binary has some rudimentary ipfs CLI
functionality but mostly in the aim of testing the `rust-ipfs` via:

 * [ipfs-rust-conformance](https://github.com/ipfs-rust/ipfs-rust-conformance)
 * [interop](https://github.com/ipfs-rust/interop/)

HTTP specs:

 * https://docs.ipfs.io/reference/api/http/

Status: Pre-alpha, most of the functionality is missing or `501 Not
Implemented`. See the repository level README for more information.
