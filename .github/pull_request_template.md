### Checklist

<!-- Additionally, updates should conform closely as possible to the [Definition of Done](https://github.com/ipfs/devgrants/tree/master/open-grants/ipfs-rust#definition-of-done) defined in the devgrant proposal. This includes: -->

- [ ] **New** code is “linted” i.e. code formatting via rustfmt and language idioms via clippy
- [ ] There are no extraneous changes like formatting, line reordering, etc. Keep the patch sizes small!
- [ ] There are functional and/or unit tests written, and they are passing
- [ ] There is suitable documentation. In our case, this means:
    - [ ] Each command has a usage example and API specification
    - [ ] Top-level commands with subcommands display usage instructions
    - [ ] Rustdoc tests are passing on all code-level comments
    - [ ] Differences between Rust’s IPFS implementation and the Go or JS implementations are explained
