## Description

This repository contains the crates for the IPFS core implementation which includes a blockstore, libp2p integration, and HTTP API bindings. Our goal is to leverage both the unique properties of Rust to create powerful, performant software that works even in resource-constrained environments while maximizing interoperability with the other "flavors" of IPFS, namely JavaScript and Go.

### Project Status - `Pre-Alpha`

There's a lot of great work in here, and a lot more coming that isn't implemented yet. Recently, this project was awarded a [dev grant from Protocol Labs](https://github.com/ipfs/devgrants/tree/master/open-grants/ipfs-rust), empowering us to raise our level of conformance. After the grant work is complete the project will achieve alpha stage.

### You can help.

PRs and Issues accepted for any of the following. See [the contributing docs](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for more info.
* Implement endpoints not covered by the devgrant proposal. See the [roadmap section](#roadmap) below
* Back the project financially by reaching out or by becoming a backer on [OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/ipfs-rust)

### What is IPFS?

IPFS is a global, versioned, peer-to-peer filesystem. It combines good ideas from previous systems such Git, BitTorrent, Kademlia, SFS, and the Web. It is like a single bittorrent swarm, exchanging git objects. IPFS provides an interface as simple as the HTTP web, but with permanence built in. You can also mount the world at /ipfs.

For more info see: https://docs.ipfs.io/introduction/overview/

## Install

The `rust-ipfs` binaries can be built from source. Our goal is to always be compatible with the **stable** release of Rust.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/ipfs-rust/rust-ipfs && cd rust-ipfs
$ cargo build --workspace
```

You will then find the binaries inside of the project root's `/target/debug` folder.

_Note: binaries available via `cargo install` is coming soon._

## Getting started
```rust,no_run
use async_std::task;
use futures::join;
use ipfs::{IpfsOptions, IpfsPath, Ipld, Types, UninitializedIpfs};
use libipld::ipld;

fn main() {
    env_logger::init();
    let options = IpfsOptions::<Types>::default();

    task::block_on(async move {
        // Start daemon and initialize repo
        let (ipfs, fut) = UninitializedIpfs::new(options).await.start().await.unwrap();
        task::spawn(fut);

        // Create a DAG
        let f1 = ipfs.put_dag(ipld!("block1"));
        let f2 = ipfs.put_dag(ipld!("block2"));
        let (res1, res2) = join!(f1, f2);
        let root = ipld!([res1.unwrap(), res2.unwrap()]);
        let cid = ipfs.put_dag(root).await.unwrap();
        let path = IpfsPath::from(cid);

        // Query the DAG
        let path1 = path.sub_path("0").unwrap();
        let path2 = path.sub_path("1").unwrap();
        let f1 = ipfs.get_dag(path1);
        let f2 = ipfs.get_dag(path2);
        let (res1, res2) = join!(f1, f2);
        println!("Received block with contents: {:?}", res1.unwrap());
        println!("Received block with contents: {:?}", res2.unwrap());

        // Exit
        ipfs.exit_daemon();
    });
}
```

More usage examples coming soon :+1:

## Roadmap

A large portion of this work is covered by an [IPFS Devgrant from Protocol Labs](https://github.com/ipfs/devgrants/tree/master/open-grants/ipfs-rust). In the proposal, we discussed using implemented HTTP API endpoints as a metric to determine progress. _There are always opportunities for community members to contribute by helping out with endpoints not covered in the grant._

### Devgrant Phase 1 - `Complete`

* Project Setup
* Testing Setup
    * Conformance testing
* HTTP API Scaffolding
* `/pubsub/{ publish, subscribe, unsubscribe, peers, ls }`
* `/swarm/{connect, peers, addrs, localAddrs, disconnect }`
* `/id`
* `/version`
* `/stop`
* `/block/{ get, add, rm, stat }`
* `/dag/{ put, resolve }`
* `/refs` and `/refs/local`
* `/bitswap/{ stat, wantlist }`

### Work still required (APIs)

- Interop testing
- /pin
- /bootstrap
- /dht
- /name
- /ping
- /key
- /config
- /stats
- /files (regular and mfs)
- a few other miscellaneous endpoints not enumerated here
